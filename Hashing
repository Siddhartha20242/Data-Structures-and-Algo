Introduction to hasing:
- Hashing is a techquine used to convert a range of key values into a range of indices of an
array. It is commonly used for fast data retrieval.

      Importance of Hashing
- Hasing allows for quick data retrieval, particularly useful when counting occurences in 
 datasets.

              Problem: Counting Occurences in an Array

Problem Statement
- Given an array of integers and a list of queries, count how many times each queried integer
appears in the array.

                          Brute Force Approach
Using nested loops to count occurences results in a time complexity of O(Q * N).

Example Code:

    function CountOccurenceBrute(arr, queries){
      return queries.map(query => {
           let count = 0;
           for (let num of arr){
               if (num === query) 
                   count ++;
           }
             return count;
      });
    }

const arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2];
const queries = [1, 3, 4, 2, 10];
console.log(countOccurenceBrute(arr, queries))
